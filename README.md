# Robot wars inspired robot

Here is my design for my custom fighter robot. I am going to create it using a raspberry pi pico, TT motors, L298N motor drivers, and a servo motor. It will be controlled by a 433mhz radio frequency remote, another raspberry pi pico & a joystick module. The main axe weapon and chassis will be 3d printed in PLA. It will be powered by AA batteries and I will mostly likely use a mix of a custom made PCB and a jumper wire setup for component connections
